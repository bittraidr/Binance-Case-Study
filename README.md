# Case Study of Binance (Binance.com and Binance.us)

## Overview and Origin

* Binance was founded in China in 2017 by Changpeng Zhao, who also goes my the nickname CZ. He is the CEO and has been since 2017. The Binance.us CEO is Brian Shroder, a former executive director of Ant Group Co. and Uber Technologies Inc. Crypto currency was gaining a lot of international momentum in 2017 and CZ identified a need for a user-friendly and safe platform for cryptocurrency trading. Binance ran an Initial Coin Offering in July 2017 during a crypto bull run. The proceeds from the ICO provided the initial funds for the platform's development. After the exchange opened, the primary revenue mechanism comes from the trading fees generated on the platform. Along with trading fees, Binance profits from commissions from OTC transactions, coin listings, advertising and other partnerships.  


## Business Activities

* Binance offers services worldwide in addition to US based customers. They provide access to digital assets or in other words a wide array of cryptocurrencies to customers to buy, trade or otherwise invest in. With that said, they're exchanges offer liquidity and are a financial ecosystem of their own. They attract a large base of investors from guppies to whales, meaning they accommodate large and small investors and traders. Their exchange is the largest and can handle very high volume and offer some of the lowest trading fees of all exchanges. 

* Binance drives revenue through its various services on its platform for its customers. Retail customers that want to buy, sell and trade cryptocurrencies. However, as of writing, Binance is being investigated and targeted by the SEC. They have been charged with mishandling customer funds. As a result of these charges, Binance is at least temporarily becoming a crypto only exchange. This could severely hurt the exchange's revenues if customers cannot transfer crypto to fiat and then to their banks. 

* Binance also offers services designed for institutional traders like hedge funds, investment firms and large independent traders. They do this by providing access to larger liquidity pools. Binance also has Binance Smart Chain that intends to be a developer platform. In addition to the above, they help start-ups with initial coin offerings and token sales by exposing the new start-ups to the large Binance user base. 

* According to businesssofapps.com Binance has about 28.6 million users as of October 2021. 


### Competitive Advantage

* Binance offers a competitive advantage in the form of their own blockchain for developers to build on, BNB Chain. This is unique and allows Binance to attract more projects, adds additional value to BNB Chain, the native currency to the exchange. More projects being developed means more energy being put into the Binance ecosystem and more chatter in the cryptocurrency community, which in turn draws even more in. 


### Current Technologies User By Binance

According to StackShare Binance's tech stack includes: 
* Java, 
* Nginx, 
* Amazon Web Services, 
* Amazon cloud, 
* next.js, 
* Ant design

* Cell phone app technologies such as Go, and Swift for Android and Iphone.

* BNB Chain, the Binance crypto blockchain, which is an EVM-compatible network, forked from “go-ethereum”. According to https://research.binance.com/en/projects/bnb.

* For frontend, web based languages for trading platforms often use technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript frameworks like React, Angular, or Vue.js.

* For security, Binance uses encryption, two-factor authentication (2FA), secure socket layers (SSL), and other security protocols to protect user accounts and transactions.

## Landscape

* Binance is a prominent player in the domain of cryptocurrency and digital asset exchange. It operates as a cryptocurrency exchange platform that allows users to trade a wide range of digital currencies, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, and many others. Binance provides services for buying, selling, and storing cryptocurrencies, as well as various trading features such as spot trading, futures trading, and margin trading. The company is primarily focused on the crypto industry and plays a significant role in facilitating the exchange and trading of digital assets for individuals and institutions.

### Trends and Innovations

* The cryptocurrency space is flush with innovations and here are five trends:

1. Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) and Initial Exchange Offereings (IEOs) have become the most popular fundraising method.  

2. Decentralized Exchanges (DEXs) are another innovation opposed to centralized exchanges. These exchanges operate on blockchain technology and enable peer-to-peer trading of cryptocurrencies without the need for intermediaries. Where they sometimes lack in liquidity, they are able to provide users privacy and control of their tokens and coins. Another great innovations are multi-signature wallets, hardware wallets, and secure storage solutions have been developed to protect users' digital assets. This is to address concerns of hacking and theft, which still can occur, however usually it's through hacking of email accounts to get backups as the wallets are much more difficult to hack otherwise.

3. Governments have been struggling to keep up with regulating the cryptocurrency realm. As of writing this, Binance has been charged with mishandling customer funds, and has declared cryptos like Cardano, Polygon, as well as Binance's coin BNB unregistered securities. Regulatory clarity has been very slow to evolve and the path to do such has been murky, though it's generally agreed that regulations help protect investors. 

4. Non-Fungible Tokens, or NFTs, can be created on the BNB Chain. These can be bought and sold on https://www.binance.com/en/nft/home.

5. Stable coins like BUSD, USDC and Tether emerged as a type of cryptocurrency designed to minimize price volatility by pegging their price fixed to the value of a dollar. Stable coins have gained popularity as they offer stability for traders, enable cross-border payments, and facilitate liquidity on exchanges.

### Competitors 

* Three prominent competitors:

1. Coinbase, OKX, Kraken are a few others of the largest and popular cryptocurrency exchanges globally. They provide a user-friendly platform for buying, selling, and storing various cryptocurrencies. Coinbase offers services for retail investors as well as institutions and has played a significant role in the mainstream adoption of cryptocurrencies, especially in the US, but they have branched out globally as well. According to coinbase.com, Coinbase is available in many European countries as well as Canada. 

2. OKX has a user base of over 20 million people from more than 100 countries, according to coinstats.app. It currently supports over 300 cryptos. However, it currently does not accept users from the United States due to regulatory concerns. 

3. Kraken was founded in San Francisco in 2011 and currently supports users from 190 countries. It is a trusted and secure exchange, although its customer support has received some criticism for the length of time tickets are resolved. 

## Results

* Binance has gained a reputation as the largest exchange globally, with high trading volume and the largest user base. Users are drawn to Binance due to its user-friendly interface, extensive selection of cryptocurrencies, and competitive fee structure. Binance.US caters to customers in the United States, while Binance Jersey serves the European market. These features contributed to the widespread adoption and accessibility of cryptocurrencies.

* Binance's offerings include futures trading, margin trading, options trading, and lending services. By expanding its product range, Binance has attracted both retail and institutional traders, and this is driving its growth and diversifying its revenue streams.

* Binance also offers a Launchpad platform for initial exchange offerings (IEOs). Binance investigates these tokens for scalability, maturity, and if it's genuinely beneficial to the overall blockchain. So far, about 60 projects have raised funds on the Launchpad since 2019.  

* Binance Coin (BNB) is the house token and as Binance's native utility token operating on the Binance Chain, BNB offers various benefits for trading like fee discounts and trading incentives. The BNB token currently has a market cap of about $37 billion, making it the number 4 crypto according to coinmarketcap.com and a value of $239 per token. 

* Binance also offers BNB chain, which is a merger of its previous Binance Smart Chain and Binance Chain together. It is a blockchain for developers deploying dApps powered by smart contracts. BNB means “Build 'N Build” according to CEO Changpeng Zhao. BNB uses a proof-of-staked authority algorithm, or PoSA. Network participants validate blocks on the chain in this way, and it's run by users. 


### Core Metrics 

* Trade Volume: Binance.com and Binance.us combine for a current average of about $64 billion in daily trade volume. Of course, the crypto market is volatile, and these numbers fluctuate greatly on a day-to-day basis. For instance, in 2021 the average volume was $147.6 billion and in 2022 $94 billion.  Binance hosts about 55% of all crypto spot treading as of January 2023 according to finder.com.


* User Base: The total user base of Binance.com and Binance.us is approx 128 millions users. In comparison, to the next largest exchange, Coinbase has about 108 million users. Though there is overlap as most users actually are signed up on both exchanges. The Binance NFT division in 2022 had about 600,000 weekly users. 


* Revenue and Profitability: Sites like businessofapps.com reported Binance made about $20 billion in revenue in 2020 and 2021 and $6.4 billion in 2022 in comparison to Coinbase which generate about $3.1 billion in profits. In 2021 Binance reported $145 million in net profits. This figure varies based on the current popularity of crypto and market conditions such as investor sentiment and interest rates.  


### Performance

* In terms of trading volume, market share Binance lead in that metric as well in 2022 with about 66.7%, though started the year with about 50%. This is among 11 exchanges being tracked for 2022. Second place market share was Coinbase at 8.2%. This is according to coindesk.com.


* According to Investopedia, which sites Trustpilot reviews. There have been several complaints revolving around poor customer service and difficulty withdrawing funds. Thus, Binance averages about 2 out of 5 stars. When checking Trustpilot reviews, Binance has about 16% 5-star reviews, however about 67% 1-star reviews. Of course dissatisfied people might actually make the effort to post a review opposed to satisfied people, this shows that there is a ton of room for improvement. My advice below could help solve this issue. In comparison, Coinbase has an average of 1.5 stars and OKX has a 3 out of 5 star average. 


* In the area of regulatory compliance, Binance is at this time of writing this in hot water in the US with the SEC. They as of now have avoided having their assets completely frozen as decided by a D.C. District Court Judge, Amy Berman, so long as the parties involved could agree on limits. The SEC alleges Binance has sold unregistered securities such as BNB and mishandled customer funds. Regulations are meant to protect investors and Binance a newer entity, so hopefully the negotiations between the US SEC and Binance will yield a positive direction for the industry as a whole.


## Recommendations

* An additional service for Binance to consider is in-site forums or live message chats, similar to what coinmarketcap.com offers. Binance does have a blog, since a lot of the top traders frequently use these exchanges, it would be great to provide a social area for everyone. There are similar chats for certain aspects on Telegram or Twitter, but having a central location within Binance would also be beneficial too. 
The dev channel for Binance on telegram is very slow to respond, sometimes taking days, and this is because the staff answering tickets is very limited. A community can answer questions much quicker and for free!


* When someone has an issue, it's much more helpful to be able to aggregate answers from many people rather than one or two technical employees. That few technical workers are answering many questions, however if there were open forums or chats on Binance then it's much more likely to get answers to questions. Also, I think this applies in terms of investment as well. Users would be able to push products and gather momentum. In this is would draw more users to the platform. There could be some drawbacks like spambots, but the admins on telegram have tools to deal with those, so could Binance. 


### Technology To Implement 

* There are already some chat platforms in existence that could be integrated into the Binance website. Chatwee is a platform which can be embedded into websites that offer group chat and private messaging and comes equipped for file sharing and customizable chat appearance. Admins have the ability to set up profanity filters, ban users, as well as monitor chat activity.
        
* Another option is NodeBB which is scalable with a plugin system and a responsive design across to various screen sizes which provides users with a friendly environment no matter what device they are using. Users have the ability to make profiles and admins can set permissions and guidelines. 


* The goal would be to create more interactive and engaging communication on the Binance platform itself. These technologies could possibly help users not feel neglected when they have an issue, as their peers would maybe be able to share insight or experiences dealing with similar issues. This in turn might help reduce the amount of negative experience that lead to negative reviews.
